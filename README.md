# PyWright
Python game engine for running visual novel games similar to the Phoenix Wright series

## Requirements for building/running from source
You will need the following:
- Python 2.7
- Pygame 1.9.1
- NumPy 1.6.2

To pack the file into an exe, you can use Py2Exe or Py2App for Windows and OS X respectively.

This version has Android functionality built in. Unfortunately, I don't know how to compile it (I might have a lead though on what he used)

### NOTES:
The reason why a older version needs to be used (as of this writing the most recent version is 1.10) because of the color tinting problem.
If you suffer from this, use the suggested version. Otherwise, a new NumPy could be used.

Also if you suffer problems from missing SimpleJSON, then you can do install so using PIP.

## License
Under the New BSD License. This engine uses some assets by Capcom. I might remove/change them from this repo to avoid some problems.
