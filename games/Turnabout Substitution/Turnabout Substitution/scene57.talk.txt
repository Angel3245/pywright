"Does anything come to mind that{n}could lead to Erlenmeyer?"
char Rhea e=normal
"I'm not sure. It's pretty clear{n}that he's awfully good at hiding."
"Personally, I've always thought{n}that he was faking his madness."
"To kill so many people without{n}getting caught or even being{n}suspected..."
"No way his mind{n}wasn't fully functional."
char Apollo hide
"Well, it would seem that the world's{n}best psychologists disagree with{n}you in that regard."
"But I guess you have a point."
char Rhea e=normal
"Well, at any rate, we have{n}to assume that he is completely{n}aware of his actions."
"If I were the killer, I wouldn't{n}stay in the area. I would run as far{n}away as I could,"
"and I would be constantly{n}changing appearances and staying{n}on the move."
"So we probably won't be able{n}to find him on our own. Our{n}best chance to get him now, I think,"
"would be to have a well-informed{n}public on the lookout for him."
"If you ask me, we ought to{n}stop worrying about things that{n}we can't control."
"After all, there's nothing{n}we can do about the things we{n}have to live without..."

"Isn't that a song?"
char Rhea e=normal
"What? No, I don't think so.{n}Apollo, you say some of the most{n}ridiculous things."
char Apollo hide
"But I could swear that's a{n}line from a song."
char Rhea e=normal
"Whatever. Anyway, as for me, I've{n}had enough of these murders."
"Let's stop fussing about things{n}we can't control, and have{n}some fun while we still can."
char Apollo hide
"{c099}(What does she mean by {c900}things{n}we can't control?"
