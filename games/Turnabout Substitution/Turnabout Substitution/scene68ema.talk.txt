"Really? Why was he killed in{n}such a strange way?"
char Ema e=won't-share
"It seems that Chambers and{n}Erlenmeyer struggled..."
"...since the car's alarm system was{n}set off and contacted{n}the police."
"Erlenmeyer was pressed for time as{n}a result, and so he killed Chambers{n}with the car."
char Apollo hide
"The car alarm contacted you?"
char Ema e=hiya
"Yeah. It's a new device that{n}automatically contacts the police{n}and gives us the car's location..."
