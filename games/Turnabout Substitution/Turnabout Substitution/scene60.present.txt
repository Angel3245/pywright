"That side of him always annoyed{n}me: he would always think of{n}others before himself."
"He doesn't want to let people{n}down, so he'll generally do whatever{n}is asked of him."
"He's so altruistic that he{n}forgets the notions of self-respect{n}and dignity."

"Judge told me that when you were{n}young, you put many corrupt leaders{n}and businessmen behind bars,"
"despite received numerous threats."
"At first, I misunderstood him, and{n}thought you were power dating them,{n}but that didn't make much sense."
"Anyway, I just wanted to tell{n}you that your determination inspires{n}me."
"Putting your life on the line{n}for the sake of justice is what a{n}lawyer ought to do."
"I've always felt that we stood for{n}more than just ourselves, but I{n}don't know if I can do it."
"So I wanted to ask you, if I ever get{n}into danger because of my pursuit...{p20}{n}what should I do?"
"How do I keep focused on that{n}goal, when my own safety is at{n}risk?"
char Poole e=serious-outofcourt
"It's not so simple, not at all.{n}I'm not the hero you think I am."
"As usual, the judge must have been{n}exaggerating the facts. You can{n}never completely"
"disregard your safety, and you{n}really shouldn't. It doesn't make you{n}brave, only stupid."
"When you're dead, there's{n}nothing left to fight for."
"To get those convictions, I{n}had to work behind the scenes, stab{n}innocent people in the back,"
"all so I could go on prosecuting."
"I rarely confronted my enemies{n}directly- it would have been{n}far too dangerous."
"Above all, you need to remember{n}that you can't fight all of the evil in{n}the world at once."
"I had to let some of those bastards{n}go, dropping charges against known{n}criminals more than"
"once so that I could come back{n}and hit hundreds of others in the{n}long run."
"So my advice is: if you find{n}yourself in a situation like that, you{n}should opt for a way"
"to stay alive without giving up.{n}And if the only alternative to death is{n}to give up the fight...{p35}"
"then you should give up. Trust{n}me. You're still young, and you don't{n}want to die or"
"seriously mess up your life for{n}something you don't even really{n}understand yet."
