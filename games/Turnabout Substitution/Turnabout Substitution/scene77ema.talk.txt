"No, not at all, don't worry. {enormal}For{n}starters, it has nothing to do{n}with influenza. It reacts with"
"the pigment in the skin and fur of{n}mice and paralyzes their muscles,{n}but the effects on humans are much"
"less dramatic. It also is not an{n}airborne disease, meaning you need{n}to be in contact with infected"
"animals to contract it. It really{n}shouldn't be a concern..."
"but you might want to meet with{n}your doctor, just in case."
