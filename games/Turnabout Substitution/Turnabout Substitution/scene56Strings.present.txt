"You want to know about me, Mr.{n}Justice? A man wrapped up in himself{n}makes a very small bundle,"

"Contrary to what you may expect, I{n}came from a poor, uneducated{n}working-class family."

"I chose to read books in order to{n}escape from my troubles. In them, I{n}discovered a fascinating world"
"of ancient, civilized cultures{n}so different from the one I{n}inhabited."
 "I was filled with awe by the greatness{n}of these ancient civilizations." 
"I do not know what I may appear to{n}the world- but to myself I seem to{n}have been only like a boy"
"playing on the seashore, while the{n}great ocean of truth lay all{n} undiscovered before me,"
"Isaac Newton once said."
"What I found truly fascinating about{n}these stories was this world of pure{n}ideas: concepts such as truth,"
"justice, and honor. Amicus Plato,{n}amicus Aristoteles, magis amica{n}veritas."

"The reason I became a judge was to{n}feel the reality of these notions.{n}At least,"
"that is what I believed." 
"But now I must wonder, was I merely{n}attracted by power, fame, and{n}fortune?"
"Was it that I actually wanted to{n}show my father my worth?" 
"Perhaps if that was my goal, then I{n}have failed."

"Nonsense. My father was a good{n}man- how could my father be {n}anything else?"
"Even in his violence, he was{n}being good to me." 
"It was his way of being honest,{n}however brutal. Though he never{n}read about the concept of truth,"
"he never lied to me."
"But what have I done, but lie?{n}Lying is all I have done, all{n}of it to advance my career."
"My ambitions for greatness have{n}brought me to ruin. I believe that{n}my father recognized that in me,"
"and he tried to warn me in his own{n}way. But now, finally, I have changed."
"I've chosen to sacrifice all of{n}my ill-gotten power in order to do{n}what I knew was right."
"Though I may never again be{n}powerful, I will no longer be cursed{n}with misery."
"Finally, though I am imprisoned,{n}I feel that I am free for the first time."

"Such a brilliant and accomplished{n}young man, and he's my own son. I{n}could not possibly be"
"more proud of him." 
"I realize now that he may not{n}know that. But maybe he doesn't{n}need to know."
"At any rate, his truly remarkable{n}property is his insatiable curiosity."
"Just about anything may take{n}his interest, whether or not it is truly{n}worthy of his attention."
"No matter whether it is eighteenth{n}century mathematics, or intellectual{n}property law, or"
"the sexuality of insects,"
"or merely the newest video game, he{n}will take to them all with equal fervor.{n}In his mind, it seems, learning and"
"having fun are one and the same,{n}a property that is as beneficial as it is{n}remarkable. Education,"
"Socrates once said, is the{n}kindling of a flame, not{n}the filling of a vessel.

"To be rather frank, this worries{n}me on occasion. Neither abstinence{n}nor excess ever renders man happy,"
"Voltaire once said. Attending parties,{n}seducing women, these activities are{n}necessary to lead a"
"happy and successful life."
"But he has such low self-esteem,{n}it pains me to say. He's shy and{n}awkward, and even when he's"

"I want society to accept my son, but{n}he just doesn't seem to care whether{n}they do or not."
"That's why I had to help him in that{n}regard, though I often think that I{n}ought to leave him be." 
"Now I can't help but think that he{n}might not have even wanted to be a{n}judge." 
"He seems to be missing a certain{n}concept of justice."
"He enjoys a criminal case because he{n}views it as a puzzle to be solved, but{n}he doesn't seem"
"to have a full grasp of the{n}human consequences of his{n}decisions."
"Four things belong to a judge:{n}to hear courteously, to answer{n}wisely, to consider soberly,"
