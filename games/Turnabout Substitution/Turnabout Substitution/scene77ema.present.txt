"You gotta get a lot of calls from{n}alarms... Why was this{n}one so important?"
char Ema e=hair
"Well, not many people have that{n}particular alarm installed,{n}it's pretty expensive..."
"{enormal}But it's so expensive because{n}it's state-of-the-art."
"{eglasses}Each alarm system has the ID{n}of its owner registered{n}in police data."
"So when the alarm went off, we saw{n}that it was from Chambers' car,{n}and rushed to see what happened."
"{eprofile}It's a good thing we did, or{n}Erlenmeyer might have{n}escaped again..."

"...I can't believe he's dead."
"I mean, just the other day he was in{n}the defendant's chair, sweating{n}bullets, wishing he could go home..."
"{emu}and now he's gone."
"{ehair}I remember when I first met him...{n}If you've studied Mr. Wright, you{n}have to know about SL-9."
"I first met him in that case.{n}Everyone was trying to{n}get me to talk..."
"...but he was the only one{n}who cared about me, instead{n}of what I knew."
"{eprofile}He may not be the most competent{n}judge I've met, but he's {n}definintely the nicest."
"{emu}...I don't have time to reminiscence.{n}I need to focus on the case, to put{n}the one who killed him behind bars!{f}"

#PRESENT ERLENMEYER
label erlenmeyerupdated$
char Apollo hide
"From the beginning, no one could tell{n}how severe his mental condition{n}was, or even if he had one at all."
"I've talked to him, and I{n}could barely understand{n}what he was saying."
"But yesterday you said he was able{n}to understand Strings' plan."
"And now that another murder{n}has been committed, what's{n}your opinion?"
char Ema e=hair
"He's smarter than I{n}gave him credit for."
"He had time to plan out his previous{n}crimes, and all he had to do to{n}escape was follow Strings' order."
"{eprofile}But here, the crime wasn't{n}premeditated..."
"He had to think on his feet to use{n}Chambers' own car and kill him in{n}the quickest way possible."
"{euninterested}If he hadn't fainted, he could've{n}dumped the body somewhere{n}and escaped."
char Apollo hide
"But couldn't we come across the{n}exact same scene if Erlenmeyer was{n}innocent and just framed?"
char Ema e=won't-share
"There's too much evidence against him."
"There's no way you'll be able to use{n}his insanity to prove his innocence,{n}like what happened in his first trial."

#PRESENT GUM

char Apollo hide
"{c099}(This is probably a long shot, but...)
"Hey, Ema, I found these pieces of{n}gum while investigating the scene."
char Ema e=adjusts
"Really? I didn't see them."
char Apollo hide
"Well, they were buried{n}under the snow."
char Ema e=hair
"Under the snow, eh?{n}That's interesting..."
"{eglasses}I have a {f}{sfx\Key.ogg}{c900}weather report {c}that says{n}the last time it snowed was between{n}12:30 and 1:10AM this morning."
char Apollo hide
"{sfx\Ding.ogg}{f}Ah..! That means that these pieces{n}of gum were dropped {c900}at the moment{n}of the murder{c}!"
char Ema e=uninterested
"Don't get ahead of yourself. It just{n}means that they weren't dropped{n}after the murder."
"{esmirks}They could have been dropped long before the murder."
char Apollo hide
"{c099}(...No, that doesn't work! They were in the middle of the layer of snow,)"
"{c099}(meaning they were dropped after{n}it started snowing!)"
"{c099}(...It's probably not a good idea to{n}let her know about that and{n}reveal my hand.)"
"Oh, right..."
char Ema e=profile
"Even if they were dropped during{n}the murder, they wouldn't help{n}you much."
"{esmirks}If they are Erlenmeyer's, it's just{n}evidence against him, and if they are{n}Chambers', they are meaningless."
char Apollo hide
"But what if they belong to a third{n}person, the true murderer?" #MC: Heh, he learned from Phoenix.
char Ema e=hair
"How do you want to prove that they{n}belong to this person? It's not like{n}he'll just tell you."
char Apollo hide
"Right... What if we check{n}for fingerprints?"
char Ema
"I doubt the pieces of gum have{n}fingerprints if they were dropped."
char Apollo hide
"Oh, yeah..."
"{c099}(Argh! I thought I was onto{n}something! *sigh* Maybe I'll be able{n}to use them in a different way...)"

#PRESENT STEERING WHEEL
label steeringwheel
char Apollo hide
"Ema, did you check the steering{n}wheel of Chambers' car for{n}fingerprints?"
char Ema e=smirks
"Of course. So you want to know{n}what we found?"
char Apollo hide
"...Something tells me I don't."
char Ema
"...You're probably right. We found{n}two sets of prints: one from{n}Judge Chambers, and one from..."
"{emu}{s}{sfx\Smack.ogg}Robert Erlenmeyer."
char Apollo hide
"Erlenmeyer's?!{n}{c099}(Just as I feared...)"
char Ema e=hair
"You know what this means, right?{n}There is no reason for Erlenmeyer's{n}fingerprints to be there..."
"{eprofile}unless he's the {s}{sfx\Dunnn.ogg}culprit."
char Apollo hide
"{c099}(That's... pretty convincing...)"
"This looks pretty bad for{n}Erlenmeyer... but there still isn't any{n}evidence proving he wasn't framed.)"

"You know, I'm not actually{n}munching. I'm just pretending{n}because I don't want to talk to you."
"...About this."
char Apollo hide

"{c099}(This conversation sounds familiar.)" #MC: You said to add nothing, but I couldn't resist.
