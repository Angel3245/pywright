"I first met him in that case.{n}Everyone was trying to{n}get me to talk..."
"...but he was the only one{n}who cared about me, instead{n}of what I knew."
"{eprofile}He may not be the most competent{n}judge I've met, but he's {n}definintely the nicest."
"{emu}...I don't have time to reminiscence.{n}I need to focus on the case, to put{n}the one who killed him behind bars!{f}"

"From the beginning, no one could tell{n}how severe his mental condition{n}was, or even if he had one at all."
"I've talked to him, and I{n}could barely understand{n}what he was saying."
"But yesterday you said he was able{n}to understand Strings' plan."
"And now that another murder{n}has been committed, what's{n}your opinion?"
char Ema e=hair
"He's smarter than I{n}gave him credit for."
"He had time to plan out his previous{n}crimes, and all he had to do to{n}escape was follow Strings' order."
"{eprofile}But here, the crime wasn't{n}premeditated..."
"He had to think on his feet to use{n}Chambers' own car and kill him in{n}the quickest way possible."
"{euninterested}If he hadn't fainted, he could've{n}dumped the body somewhere{n}and escaped."
char Apollo hide
"But couldn't we come across the{n}exact same scene if Erlenmeyer was{n}innocent and just framed?"
