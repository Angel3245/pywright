"{esad}...It was stupid to think you{n}took the case to spite me."

"No, I should've known{n}how you'd react--"

char Rhea
"You didn't do anything wrong,{n}so {s}{sfx/Smack.ogg}{emad}just let me apologize, okay?{n}{enormal}You only did what you thought"
"was right. You thought he might{n}have been wrongly accused...{n}just like with Chambers three"
"days ago. Nobody believed him,{n}all the evidence pointed to him,{n}yet you believed in his innocence"
"and took the case... and won.{n}Your strong conviction... that's{n}what I {sfx/Key.ogg}like about you, Polly."
"...Maybe you'll be right this{n}time, too. {esad}And even if Erlenmeyer{n}killed my brother..."
"I suppose if he really didn't{n}kill Judge, he doesn't deserve{n}to be declared guilty for it."
"{esmiling1}I figured I'd give you a second{n}chance. {enormal}So what have you found{n}so far?"

"Well, there's a{n}{c900}Mysterious Bust crime scene{c}{n}in this school here."

"{sfx/Shock.ogg}{s}What?!"

"Yeah, in Erlenmeyer's{n}old biology classroom."

char Rhea
"...This isn't very good{n}for our case, Polly."

char Apollo hide
"No, it's great! Remember how{n}there would always be pictures{n}of the victim?"

char Rhea e=surprised
"{sfx/Smack.ogg}!!{p30}{n}But that means...{n}Erlenmeyer is innocent!"
"{emad}...Argh! {esad}I should have just{n}trusted you from the start..."

char Apollo hide
"Your reaction was perfectly{n}understandable, Rhea."

char Rhea
"...Thanks, Polly."

char Apollo hide
"Rhea, I think I'm onto something.{n}Something big. I think maybe{n}Erlenmeyer isn't just innocent"
"of this murder... maybe he's{n}innocent of {sfx/Ding.ogg}{c900}all{c} the murders.{n}And the real serial killer is"
"out there, feeling cocky and{n}confident because the police took{n}the wrong guy."
"But to bring this guy out of the{n}shadow and expose him..."
"I'm going to need your insight,{n}your strength... your wit.{n}I need {sfx/Key.ogg}{c900}you{c}, Rhea."

char Rhea e=smiling2
"Don't worry, Polly. I'll do{n}everything in my power to help{n}you! {enormal}...Phew, I'm glad"
"everything is back to normal!{n}Now then, let's continue{n}investigating!"
