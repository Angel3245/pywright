#TALK 1 FACTS OF THE CASE
label Facts of the Case
char Ema
"For starters, the murder occured{n}this morning at 1 AM."
char Apollo hide
"{sfx\Ding.ogg}{c099}(That's the {f}same time Erlenmeyer's{n}prison break happened!)"
char Ema e=mu
"Chambers was run over by{n}his own car."
char Apollo hide
"Really? Why was he killed in{n}such a strange way?"
char Ema e=won't-share
"It seems that Chambers and{n}Erlenmeyer struggled..."
"...since the car's alarm system was{n}set off and contacted{n}the police."
"Erlenmeyer was pressed for time as{n}a result, and so he killed Chambers{n}with the car."
char Apollo hide
"The car alarm contacted you?"
char Ema e=hiya
"Yeah. It's a new device that{n}automatically contacts the police{n}and gives us the car's location..."
"...whenever it's set off."
char Ema e=profile
"Once Chambers was unconscious,{n}Erlenmeyer took the keys and ran{n}him over, forwards and backwards."
"...several times to make{n}sure he was dead."
char Apollo hide
"That's... That's horrible!"
char Ema e=uninterested
"Anyway, we found Erlenmeyer{n}unconscious in a pool of Chambers'{n}blood. We had to arrest him..."
"{ehair}For killing Chambers, not{n}just because he was{n}an escaped convict." #MC: Sounds familiar. :P

#TALK 2 EVIDENCE
label Evidence?
char Ema
char Apollo hide
"Were there any witnesses?"
char Ema
"Not that we know of."
char Apollo hide
"...Which means that only{n}Erlenmeyer and Chambers{n}were there."
char Ema e=smirks
"Yep. Suicide is impossible{n}considering the cause of death,{n}which means you're out of luck..."
"...unless you plan on{n}accusing a zombie."
char Apollo hide
"{c099}(She's right! He can't{n}be innocent under{n}circumstances like this...)"
"Do you have any{n}decisive evidence?"
char Ema e=uninterested
"...Sorry, I can't reveal{n}everything up our sleeve."
