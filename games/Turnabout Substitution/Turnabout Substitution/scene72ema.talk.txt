"No. Chambers had to have been{n}run over in the cemetery, and{n}I'm not finding any blood or"
"traces of a struggle. Of course,{n}most of this murder hasn't been{n}consistent with Erlenmeyer's"
"usual methods... I'm going to{n}guess he planned to follow his{n}usual m.o.,"
"but something went{n}wrong along the way."

char Apollo hide
"So this can let us figure out the{n}exact modus operandi! The killer{n}met with his victims, rendered"
"them unconscious, then left a{n}scene like this where they had{n}met. Then he would go to the"
"cemetery, kill the victim, and{n}dispose of the body! It sounds{n}simple... but it fits!"

char Ema
"And this time, the victim woke up,{n}so Erlenmeyer had to get rid of{n}him with the car!"

"Well, this classroom was{n}probably Erlenmeyer's only{n}hiding spot."

char Apollo hide
"I guess, but the other{n}contradiction is more decisive...{n}Chambers' own car was parked near"
"his brother's grave, with flowers{n}in the trunk. It's pretty obvious{n}that he went there of his own"
"accord... so Erlenmeyer couldn't{n}have brought him there to dispose{n}of him! Also, if he was planning"
"on killing Chambers there,{n}shouldn't there have been{n}a knife or weapon?"

char Ema e=uninterested
"...It was just speculation. I can{n}work out the finer details later."
"{enormal}If I look over the evidence again{n}with a {eadjusts}scientific eye, {enormal}I'm sure{n}I'll find the solution!"
