"Are you ready Apollo?"
char Apollo hide
"I think so..."
char Rhea
"{sfx/Dunnn.ogg}{f}This could very well be the{n}defining case of your career!"
char Apollo hide
"Uh.. maybe..."
char Rhea
"{sfx/Smack.ogg}{s 15 15}That's right!{n}If you mess this up,{n}you're career's all over..."
char Apollo hide
"I don't really need to{n}think about that..."
char Rhea e=mad
"And an {sfx/Smack.ogg}{s 15 15}innocent old man{n}will go to jail!"
char Apollo hide 
"Rhea, you're kind of{n}overdoing this..."
char Rhea e=mad
"And the real, evil, {sfx/Smack.ogg}{s 15 15}wicked{n}murderer will go free!"
char Apollo hide
"{sfx/Dunnn.ogg}{s}THAT'S ENOUGH!"

"What's wrong?"

"Do you two know who{n}the prosecutor is?"
char Apollo hide
"Mr. Strings said it was Jessica Poole,{n}but that was the first time{n}I had heard of her."
char Rhea fade
"I remember her from the{n}Erlenmeyer trial, but I don't{n}know anything about her."
char Judge fade
"..."
char Apollo hide
"What is it?{n}Do you know about her?"
char Judge
"Of course.{n}We're... {sfx/Key.ogg}{f}former lovers."

"{sfx/Ding.ogg}{f}H-Huh?!"

char Apollo hide
"What happened between{n}the two of you?"
char Judge
"We met in law school."
"How a dork like me managed to{n}start dating the Queen of the School{n}I don't know but I managed it."
"But after we got out of law schol{n}she became a district attorney, and...{n}and something {sfx/Dunnn.ogg}{s 15 15}horrible happened!"
char Rhea fade
"What is it?"
char Judge fade
"She... she left me and{n}became a {sfx/Shatter.ogg}{s}{c900}power dater{c}!!"
char Apollo hide
"..."
char Judge
"What?"
char Apollo hide
"I thought it would be{n}something a bit... worse."
char Rhea fade e=mad
"{sfx/Smack.ogg}{s 15 15}Come on, Apollo!{n}Not only did he lose her,{n}but he didn't even have the"
"comfort of knowing that she would{n}be with someone who loved{n}and truly cared about her,"
"since she was just{n}engaged in a series of short,{n}superficial relationships!"
char Apollo hide
"Well, when you put it that{n}way, it does sound{n}pretty bad..."
char Rhea
"{sfx/Ding.ogg}{f}Exactly!{n}Anyway, then what happened?"
char Judge fade
"She took on powerful, corrupted{n}business leaders and politicians{n}like they were purse-snatchers."
"She got a lot of death threats.{n}They didn't seem to bother{n}her, but one day she just..."
"collapsed from the pressure.{n}We got back together, and I helped{n}her recover from her depression."
"But just when I was going to{n}propose to her, she{n}left the country."
char Rhea fade e=sad
"{sfx/Shock.ogg}{s}What?! Why?"
char Judge fade
"I later found out that she{n}had received another death threat..."
char Apollo hide
"Where did she go?"
char Judge
"To Charlotte Amalie.{n}She tried to live a{n}quiet, peaceful life."
"She married a young Creole{n}and had a beautiful son."
"She sent me postcards{n}every month, telling me{n}what was going on..."
"She had become a completely{n}different person."
char Rhea fade
"If she had this wonderful{n}life in the Virgin Islands,{n}why did she come back?"
char Judge fade
"...Her enemies found her.{n}The mob {sfx/gunshot.wav}{f}killed her husband and{n}son in front of her eyes."
"She immediately returned{n}to her career as a{n}prosecutor, with a passion."
"She would convict dozens of{n}criminals a year, and would not let{n}herself succumb to threats again."
"When Arthur was murdered,{n}she prosecuted Erlenmeyer{n}for my sake."
"Mr. Justice, she is a strong,{n}independent woman."
"She prosecutes with her heart,{n}and won't give up{n}until the bitter end."
"If you want to win,{n}you're going to have{n}to win her respect."
char Apollo hide
"{sfx/Key.ogg}{f}Wait a second...{n}If you have this long history with her,{n}why is she trying to put you in jail?!"
char Judge

"...I spoke to her yesterday.{n}She's convinced I'm guilty.{n}That's why she's prosecuting."
char Apollo hide
"Ergh... She sounds tough..."
"{sfx/Smack.ogg}{s 15 15}But at least she's still as much{n}a rookie as I am with{n}the Jurist System!"
char Rhea fade
"Technically, wouldn't you{n}have more experience?"
char Judge fade
"Yes, but you must now{n}also take into account{n}the bias of the jury."
"They might prefer a woman{n}to a man... especially{n}one so manipulative."
char Rhea fade e=sad
"Why would you like someone{n}who's manipulative? That doesn't{n}seem like such a nice trait..."
char Apollo hide

"...That makes sense."
