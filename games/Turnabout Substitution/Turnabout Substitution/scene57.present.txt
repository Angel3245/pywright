Hm? Well, Strings would try to{n}frame that poor old man for murder{n}for no good reason."

"Hmm...{p40} This music sheet. Is it{n}a well-known piece?"

"I don't think so. That's the{n}problem, really- if there was a certain{n}recognizable tune, it could be a clue."

"Well, if the music isn't really a{n}recognizable tune, and it doesn't{n}have a name...{p40} maybe it's"
