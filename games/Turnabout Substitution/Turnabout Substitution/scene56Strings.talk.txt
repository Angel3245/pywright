"Justice Strings, why did you go{n}through the trouble of arranging{n} Erlenmeyer's prison break,"
"and then framing Chambers{n}for his fake death?"
char Strings e=normal
"I had two reasons. The first{n}was my son. Though he may be a{n}bit air-headed on occasion,"
"he is a true genius when it comes{n}to law. I could tell that he deserved{n}to judge high-profile cases,"
"but too often he was told that{n}Chambers was the more experienced{n}of the two."
"There was no one to set up my{n}career for me, but my son is{n}still just a boy."
"There is a weakness in his heart{n}that prevents him from{n}believing in himself..."
"He needs assistance to maximize{n}his considerable potential."
"Perhaps I thought that if I helped{n}him in that regard, it would keep him{n}from making the same mistakes I did..."
char Apollo hide
"How can you act like{n}you've been altruistic?"
"You came close to destroying the{n}life of a good, innocent man.{n}You can't possibly justify that!"
char Strings e=normal
"A good man, you say? But{n}how well do you really know this{n}man?
"What do you know about the judge{n}that has presided over all of{n}your cases until now?"
char Rhea hide
"I know plenty about him. He's{n}been like a loving grandfather to me-{n}he wouldn't hurt a fly!"
char Strings e=normal
"Well, I'm afraid that there are many{n}things you do not know. Chambers,{n}the man, and Chambers, the judge,"
"are two very different people. The{n}latter, I'm afraid, has done some{n}inexcusable things in the past."
char Apollo hide
"I...{p40} I don't believe{sfx/Shock.ogg}{s} that!"
char Strings e=normal
"Of course not. I never said it{n}would be easy, but what I tell{n}you is the truth."
"Chambers would not make the{n}right decision until it did not pose{n}any risk to himself."
"And the sacrifices he made of{n}theirs to protect his own security...{p60}{n}Frankly, it's rather disgusting."
char Apollo hide
"Are you implying that he allowed{n}innocent men to be convicted?"
char Strings e=normal
"All that I'm trying to communicate is{n}that this man does not deserve all of{n}the respect that you have for him."
"That judges of important causes{n}should hold office for life is a{n}disputable thing, for the mind grows"
"old as well as the body, Aristotle{n}once said. This city needs a new{n}judge, one with a clean record."
"I did what was necessary to{n}make that a reality."
char Rhea hide
"You're a despicable man."
char Strings e=normal
"Now, hold your judgement. I{n}am not yet finished." 
"Another reason guided my actions,{n}and it was one far beyond the scope{n}of a mere individual."

"You did this for justice?"
char Strings e=thinking
"No, I did not do this for your{n}sake, Mr. Justice. What I mean is an{n}idea, a notion."
"Justice is a concept that was held in{n}great regard by ancient civilizations{n}so much more than it is today."
char Strings e=normal
"It was evident in those times{n}that the truth mattered more than{n}political differences or other such"
"irrelevant things."
"But now the expectation is just the{n}opposite: guilt or innocence is given{n}second consideration"
"to evidence and testimony, the{n}lot of which is forgery and perjury."
"An innocent man too often is found{n}guilty because of legal or political{n}circumstances outside of his control."
"Too many have lost sight of{n}the meaning of justice,"
"allowing themselves to be{n}corrupted by outside influences."
"Judges like Chambers care more{n}about themselves than those that{n}they judge."
"We've kept records of the words{n}of our ancestors, but we've{n}completely forgotten their ideals."
"It is better to risk sparing{n}a guilty person than to condemn an{n}innocent one, Voltaire once said."
char Apollo hide
"You say all of that, but it's{n}obvious what kind of person you are!"
"You talk about values like justice, but{n}in the end it's all about your own{n}interests."
"You'd stab anyone you could in the{n}back if it helps get you to the top,{n}just like with Chambers!"
char Strings e=normal
"Do you think I don't{n}know that about myself?"
"That disturbing quality has caused{n}me great illness until now."
"That is why I have decided to{n}prove the truth of my values, no{n}matter what the cost."
"That is why I am sitting in this{n}detention center right now, being{n}questioned by you."
"I stopped talking about doing{n}good, and actually did it. And yet, all{n}I have received in return is contempt."
"But that is to be expected. At{n}any rate, the two of you will not{n}be the ones to judge my fate."

"But Erlenmeyer confessed!"
char Rhea hide
"And let's not forget that he was{n}diagnosed as a sociopath by{n}numerous renowned psychologists."
char Strings e=normal
"Or rather, you might say that he{n}was diagnosed as a sociopath in light{n}of his confession."
"It is clear that he is{n}mentally unstable, at least."
"However, there is no evidence{n}in his testimony of{n}his own wrongdoing."
"Do you know how the investigation{n}in that case was conducted?"
"It was the most horrible{n}affront to justice imaginable."
"The police were desperate for clues,{n}and they were under considerable{n}pressure from the government."
"No one had an explanation for{n}these Mysterious Bust Killings."
"They were terrifying because{n}they seemed to be completely{n}meaningless, almost random."
"Neither the clues nor the choice of{n}victims made any sense, like puzzle{n}pieces that were all"
"from separate boxes."
"It all seemed...{p40} terribly arbitrary.{n}And that is why, when a poor,{n}unstable man arrived at"
"the police station confessing to{n}the crimes, the police were all too{n}eager to arrest him."
"It was much more convenient to{n}explain the strange details of{n}the case"
"than to try to understand what{n}the killer was trying to communicate."
char Rhea hide
"But it wasn't as random as you're{n}trying to make it look. He was a{n}science teacher, after all,"
"and those messages read{n}{c900}Charles Darwin."
"In that light, it's pretty hard{n}to think there isn't some connection."
char Apollo hide
"Yeah, this explanation seems a lot{n}more plausible than your conspiracy{n}theories."
char Strings e=normal
"But I believe that there is another{n}possibility, which was completely{n}ignored in that investigation."
"Is it not possible, Mr. Justice,{n}that the serial killer in these crimes is{n}not really insane at all?"
"What if this person were simply...{p40}{n}{sfx/sfx general/sfx-realization.wav}{f}purely and openly evil?"

"Just...{p40}{sfx/sfx general/sfx-realization.wav} evil? Come on,{s}{sfx/sfx general/sfx-stab.wav} nothing's{n}ever that simple."

"My son had a quote related to this,{n}though I'm not sure which famous{n}philosopher originally said it."
"It was something along these lines:{n}Some men aren't looking for anything{n}logical like money."
"They can't be bought, bullied,{n}reasoned, or negotiated with."
"Some men just want to{n}watch the world burn."
char Apollo hide
"Well, who could this{n}murderer be?"
char Rhea hide
"What sane person would go around{n}killing so many people, just for{n}the heck of it?"

"To be honest, I do not know.{n}I cannot prove it, but I'm{n}certain of it:"
"a dark truth hides at the{n}bottom of this case."
"I can't see it clearly, but{n}I can tell that it's down there."
char Apollo hide
"But just a hunch won't be enough.{n}Everything still points to Erlenmeyer."
"Don't you think it's possible{n}that you're the one who isn't facing{n}the truth here?"
char Strings e=normal
"I already knew that you would{n}be hesitant to believe me."
"But if you should choose to put{n}aside your preconceptions about{n}these case,"
"and consider what I have said,{n}then I suggest looking into the HT5{n}case files in the police station."
