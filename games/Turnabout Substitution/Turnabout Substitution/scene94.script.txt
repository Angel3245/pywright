"{prosecutor}He went there to {s 8 8}kill Judge{n}Chambers, of course."

"{defense}{ehandsondesk-nobrac}But {sfx/Ding.ogg}{f}how could he have{n}known that Chambers would{n}be there?"

defense

"{defense}{enormal-nobrac}That's right." 
"Chambers had intended to visit the{n}cemetery that afternoon,"
"for it was the{n}anniversary of his{n}brother's death."
"However, when he got home from the{n}trial, he accidentally mistook his{n}{f}soporifics for his {f}tranquilizer pills."
"As a result, he slept until{n}about midnight."

prosecutor
char Poole
"{prosecutor}{sfx /Ding.ogg}{f}What's your point?"
defense
char Apollo
"{defense}{ehandsondesk}My point is that the killer couldn't{n}have known Chambers would be in the{n}graveyard at the time!"
prosecutor
char Poole
"{prosecutor}You already said that, but{n}it doesn't make a difference."
"Whether Erlenmeyer planned it or if{n}it was by chance, they met and{n}Erlenmeyer killed Chambers."
