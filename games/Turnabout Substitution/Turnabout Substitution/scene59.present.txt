"Actually, miss, it's quite{n}possible that he may have had more{n}than twelve victims."
"The only way we know that these{n}people were killed by the serial killer is{n}because he left clues at their homes."
"Erlenmeyer could easily have killed{n}others, perhaps witnesses, and{n}chose not to leave clues,"
"simply dumping the bodies in{n}a river somewhere."
"It is quite likely that other{n}people who have disappeared were{n}murdered by that man."

"But you've also bested my father,{n}which means you must have studied{n}and in studying you"
"must have learned that man is mortal,{n}so you would have put the poison{n}as far from yourself as possible,"
