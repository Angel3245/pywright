"Funny. When I think about it,{n}Nathan and I didn't talk much."
"He was always kind of cold to{n}me, and I never felt like he really{n}trusted me."
"Because he was so distant, I{n}stopped trying to get along{n}with him as well."
"In the end, it was as if we{n}hardly even knew each other."
"But now that he's gone...{n}I think that we could{n}have got along."
"I'm sure of it."

"That's strange."

"It's just, I always had a picture{n}in my head that you and your brother{n}were real close."

"Didn't I already tell you?{n}There aren't any pictures of Nathan{n}being close,{esad} not with anyone."
"So I had to make my own..."

"Oh, I really shouldn't be dredging{n}up unpleasant memories again."

"Now why would you think that?{n}It's not a big deal to me.{n}My brother's dead and gone-"
"I buried him with my own two hands.{n}How could anything upset me{n}after such a thing?"
char Apollo hide
"Of course. I ought to know you{n}well enough to know you're not{n}the kind to cry over spilt milk."
"Or, uh, spilt blood."
