"If you've come here to interrogate{n}me about where Erlenmeyer{n}has escaped to,"
"I would advise against{n}wasting your breath."
"The police have already made{n}attempts to that end without{n}success. Frankly, I do not know"
"where he is, and even if I was privy to{n}that information, I would not share{n}it with you."

"But why? Why would you sacrifice{n}yourself for a convicted murderer?"

"Well, Mr. Justice, I feel that I am{n}morally obligated to do just that."

"But from speaking with you, Mr.{n}Justice, I receive the notion that you{n}are different."
"You are a man who cares about{n}the truth- that much is evident in{n}your eyes."
"And yet I wonder, are you ready to{n}face it?"
char Apollo hide
"Yes, of course! Just tell us{n}what you know already!"
