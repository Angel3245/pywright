"You mean Judge's murder?"

char Poole e=normal-outofcourt
"...This case is personal. First{n}Arthur, and now Judge."
"I can't just let him get away{n}with it. ...Not again.{n}I wouldn't be able to live with"
"myself if I let this case go by{n}when I had the opportunity{n}to take it."
"I will be the one to destroy him{n}in court!{n}This will truly be my last case..."
"Me and my best friend's killer,{n}face to face. I'll end my career{n}by fixing my own mess."

char Apollo hide
"Even after what you did to him{n}in his first trial?"

char Poole e=normal-outofcourt
"...This time it will be a fair{n}trial. No deals. I'll give it my{n}all, with the truth on my side..."
"and {eserious-outofcourt}{s}send that monster back to{n}where he came from. Then I'll be{n}willing go to jail for my actions."

char Apollo hide
"...It's not that simple."

char Poole e=normal-outofcourt
"For you, it is. All you need is a{n}vague feeling or a hunch, and you{n}take a case."
"You have no evidence and no plan,{n}just faith. And that's why you{n}will lose tomorrow."
"It's also why you don't have{n}more clients: you're not worth{n}the gamble."

char Rhea e=mad
"H-Hey! Polly's never lost a case!"

char Poole e=normal-outofcourt
"...Hmph. It's not like he's been{n}in very many. Your mentor was{n}lucky too, and only lost once..."
"but he only practiced for three{n}years. Do you really think he{n}could have kept that streak up"
"until today if he hadn't been{n}disbarred?"
"Plus, even a joke like Winston{n}Payne got a lucky streak at the{n}beginning of his career."
