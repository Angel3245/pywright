"The police complaints committee{n}interrogated the psychiatrists and{n}found that they had been forced"
"to write up the report by the{n}police."
"The tests upon which it was{n}supposedly based were, in fact,{n}never conducted."
"The officers were acting{n}under orders from Chief{n}of Police Jake Marshall,"

"As a result of this, Erlenmeyer's{n}verdict was changed."
"While the court held that Erlenmeyer{n}was certainly dangerous to{n}himself and others..."
"The validity of the insanity{n}plea became considerably{n}more believable."
"So he was sent to a prison asylum{n}instead of being put to death."
"It's my fault for using that{n}piece of evidence."

"It's the truth. But I wasn't{n}the only one involved."
"Judge Chambers, Chief Justice{n}Strings, and I made an arrangement."
"I wanted Erlenmeyer's head on{n}a plate, Chambers wanted revenge{n}for the death of his brother,"
"and Strings wanted more influence{n}within the judicial system."
"Strings was to prepare the evidence{n}and cover everything up, I would{n}present it to the court,"
"and Chambers would accept it. When{n}things went awry, Strings set{n}Marshall up to take the fall for us."

"That reminds me...{p20} when I spoke to{n}Judge Chambers the other day,{n}Strings interrupted us."
"He said he wanted to talk about{n}{c900}business{c}. What if it was related to{n}what happened during that case?"
char Poole e=normal-outofcourt
"I suppose."
"My guess is that the judge was{n}tempted to use what he knew about{n}us to cut a deal with the police."
"His hope was probably that if he gave{n}them information about the forgery,"
"they could be persuaded to{n}testify in a manner more{n}favorable to his case."
"At least, that's probably what Strings{n}feared, and why he came to the{n}detention center."
"He wanted to remind Chambers that{n}he was the one in charge,"
"and that he was friends with{n}the new Chief of Police."
"If Chambers talked, Strings{n}would be safe, but he{n}would know of the betrayal,"
"and there would be...{p20} ramifications."

"Now do you see why I was convinced{n}that Judge was guilty?"
"Especially if you had seen how{n}devastated he was after Arthur's{n}death."
"He was willing to do anything to{n}avenge him."
"He had no trouble forging evidence{n}so that Erlenmeyer would be put{n}to death,"
"and when that plan failed, it{n}wouldn't be such a far cry to kill{n}Erlenmeyer himself."
"By that time, however, I had{n}become ashamed of what I did."
"I couldn't stand to see him walk{n}down that path. Maybe because it{n}was so similar to my own."
"Prosecuting him was the only{n}way I could find peace of mind."
